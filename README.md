CIS 453 Unit 5 Course Project Christie Adams

Rebuilt Ling’s Cars website to reduce the clutter. View new site at: https://cadams20-prog.github.io/lingsCars/

Changes made throughout the Project

I rebuilt the home page to consist of one large car image across the top, a navbar for accessing car specials, company contact info and for setting appointments via a fillable form. There is text informing the user about the company’s accomplishments and capabilities. Additionally there four car images featuring different size cars for lease which are animated to move back a forth and are linked to other pages featuring the car and details on a background of a landscape image to provide a sense of its use. At the bottom of the home page is a list of all the car brands the company has for leasing. The theme colors for the are a deep green, orange, silver, black and white.

After class review - home page: I enlarged the text about the company’s accomplishments and capabilities and changed the color to orange to maintain the theme and make it stand out.

I reduced the animation movement on the small cars. Coded the small cars to a larger size to fill the empty space.

My pages are not responsive. (still trying to figure that out) best results view on a 14-inch screen.

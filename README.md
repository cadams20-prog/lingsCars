Rebuilt Ling’s Cars website to reduce the clutter.

Changes made throughout the Project

I rebuilt the home page to consist of one large car image across the top, a navbar for accessing car specials, company contact info and for setting appointments via a fillable form. There is text informing the user about the company’s accomplishments and capabilities. Additionally there four car images featuring different size cars for lease which are animated to move back a forth and are linked to other pages featuring the car and details on a background of a landscape image to provide a sense of its use. At the bottom of the home page is a list of all the car brands the company has for leasing. The theme colors for the are a deep green, orange, silver, black and white. 

After class review - home page: I enlarged the text about the company’s accomplishments and capabilities and changed the color to orange to maintain the theme and make it stand out. 

I reduced the animation movement on the small cars. Coded the small cars to a larger size to fill the empty space.

My pages are not responsive. (still trying to figure that out) best results view on a 14-inch screen. 




This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
